"""desktop_login.py <devtools port> [keep <server container>] <user> <password> | <devtools port> [keep <server container>] token | <devtools port> logout | <devtools port> guard <token>: logs a desktop
client in, by its login form or (token) by the token login its Jagex session variables start (prints LOGGED_IN or
FAILED: <reason>; LOGGED_IN only once the inventory widget shows container 93, FAILED when TICKS game ticks pass with no slot in it), or out through the logout tab's button (prints LOGIN_SCREEN) through its devtools endpoint; keep: logs it in again after each logout, until the desktop is gone. Keys only:
the login screen's place on the canvas changes with the window, so no point on it is clicked. It acts only on the instance
that owns the port when it starts (DESKTOP_DIR/run/<port - 7779>/owner, its up's slug and claim): no call is sent once that
instance changes hands, and keep ends then. Each call carries that up's devtools token (its up.json), which the endpoint requires.
guard: writes the instance's guard file (DevtoolsOwner reads it on each request): the token, or empty (any caller) while a
session's desktop bridge predates mcp/serve.py; keep writes it again whenever that fact changes, so the guard turns on once none lives.
